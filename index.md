Welcome to the Data Mining and Modelling for Biomedicine (DaMBi) research group.
Our group is part of the [VIB Inflammation Research Center](https://www.irc.ugent.be/) at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/) and studies the design and application of data mining and machine learning algorithms for biomedicine.
Our main research interest and expertise has been the analysis of high-throughput data to unravel specific biological research questions,
as typically generated by several ''omics'' technologies
(genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).
Currently, we are also pioneering the field of single cell analyses, where we are developing new flow cytometry bioinformatics tools.
